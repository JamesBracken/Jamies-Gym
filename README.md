# Jamie's gyms


Welcome to Jamie's gyms, the place to get fitter, faster! I chose to build a gym website with my previous sports history, I always loved it! I built this website to welcome others into the world of sports and fitness. The website has been built with our customer base in mind, considering new fresh faces to the industry and sports enthusiasts alike. We know going into a gym can be a bit daunting for most, images that are comforting and that show the enjoyment within our gym are displayed to help ease any doubts.  

The website is split into three pages, we have the landing page, classes page and our signup page (Successful signin page included in this)

2. As a company I want to clearly and descriptively convey all of my business offers to widen and drive potential client interest 
3. As a company I want a CTA that stands out, is immediately displayed on open of the webpage and is ALWAYS visible so it's always easily accessible for my potential clients

### Primary user stories

1. As a new user I would like to easily be able to navigate to the gym sign up to apply for a gym membership
2. As a user I would like to be able to quickly see any potential for discounts or savings within the gym
3. As a Fitness enthusiast I would like to be able to see detailed information of the different classes available to customers so I can decide if this is the right gym for me

### Design

#### Color Scheme

![A color palette of red, black, celadon and ivory](./assets/images/readme/color-palette.PNG)

I chose the color ivory as the main color on the website, it matches the many bright colors shown on all images. Additionally I wanted mostly warm, bright colors to convey a comforting look. I used red as a color to create focus on certain elements which I want people to look at such as our CTA signup button. I alsosubtly adjusted the background color to a ivory. Celadon was originally used for the nav and footer, however I forfeited this color as it didnt mesh well with the rest of the site.

#### Typography

![A display of different sizes, font families and colors](./assets/images/readme/typography.PNG)

For fonts I went for Oswald for headings and inter for other text. They both go well together and give a cool calm look. If there are any import issues fall backs have been added as sans-serif

#### Images

I chose images with our customers in mind, going into a gym can be a bit of a daunting task for some. We have to make sure that we display the fact that once you get into it, fitness is loved by all and it can be something everyone can enjoy. We show people enjoying themselves, having fun and reaping the benefits. We also display a few pictures which shows the heavy lifting for the truly hardcore gym enthusiasts, heavy deadlifts, martial arts classes whats not to love?I also aimed to implement similar contrast pictures to the website colors. This helped to blend well within the website.

Images were resized and compressed through [Tinyjpg](https://tinyjpg.com/) to optimize load times of the website without destroying image quality. Some images like the hero image were minimally compressed as this stands out and we do not want to reduce quality here.

#### Wireframes
I made my wireframes using figma, this was then molded and made into my websites, original designs on these figma wireframes have been tweaked. Specifically the colors within the website was changed due to celadon not being very fitting within the webpage

We have our footer displaying vital information for our users, clearly displaying the gym opening and closing times within a table. We also have our contact information displayed here, as well as our social media.

**Yoga class video** 

![A video of a yoga class](./assets/images/readme/yoga-video.PNG)

Giving a little insight into our gym classes is crucial, we have placed a short video in the classes page displaying to our user what one of our fantastic yoga classes looks like. The videos fullscreen has been purposefully disabled as the is not the intended purpose of the video, and quality is not high enough to have high quality on some screens on full screen.

### Future implementations

**Story 4** As a fitness enthusiast I would like to be able to see what amenities and
other services the gym has to offer other than weight lifting and excercise

An amenities section can be made futurewise displaying our fantastic selection within the gym. This will have its own dedicated page to showoff everything required.

**Story 5** As a new user, I would like to be able to start out my gym journey by booking a gym induction, so I am able to learn how to use gym equipment safely.

A form delived either on the home page, in a modal or on its own dedicated page will be added for our users to be able to safely and properly use our equipment.

**Story 7**  As a user I would like to be able to book classes at the click of a button so I can come whenever I want

A system wherein users are able to book their spot in a class ahead of time so that they can rest easy that their spot in the class is there.

**Story 8** As a new potential customer I would like to be able to see reviews from past gym guests to understand how others experience was within the gym 

Displaying reviews instills trust and gives a taste of things to come, so that new users can have a better understanding if this is the right fit for them. A reviews section will be added relatively near to the bottom of the page displaying constructive criticism, feedback and experiences from our customers.
## Testing

### Automated testing

#### HTML validator
My html code initially showed up with a few issues such as 
- Nesting a button tag in an anchor
- Nesting a div in a ul

I fixed these issues and no further problems were present on all pages


![A webpage showing an html validator with no issues](./assets/images/readme/html-validator-home.PNG)

#### CSS Validator
I ran my code through a CSS validator and was delighted to see no validator issues
![A page showing no error for my input code](./assets/images/readme/css-validator.PNG)

#### Lighthouse

After passing my project through lighthouse I got the below scores, very near perfect. The hero image unfortunately takes up some performance points but if optimized further becomes pixelated so I left it as is

## Development life cycle

I tracked the development of the project through a gantt chart I made using google sheets. The dates on the top, tasks on the left and green representing when the task was being worked on.
Noticeably the work is separated into 2 with the black columns. The work was initially done in November 2024 and revisited and slightly altered in January 2025, therefore was separated for clarity.
