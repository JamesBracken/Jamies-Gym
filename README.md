# Jamie's gyms


[//]: <> (UX)
Welcome to Jamie's gyms, the place to get fitter, faster! I chose to build a gym website with my previous sports history, I always loved it! I built this website to welcome others into the world of sports and fitness. The website has been built with our customer base in mind, considering new fresh faces to the industry and sports enthusiasts alike. We know going into a gym can be a bit daunting for most, images that are comforting and that show the enjoyment within our gym are displayed to help ease any doubts.  

The website is split into three pages, we have the landing page, classes page and our signup page (Successful signin page included in this)

### Design
---

- **Color Scheme**

![A color palette of red, black, celadon and ivory](./assets/images/readme/color-palette.PNG)

I chose the color ivory as the main color on the website, it matches the many bright colors shown on all images. Additionally I wanted mostly warm, bright colors to convey a comforting look. I used red as a color to create focus on certain elements which I want people to look at such as our CTA signup button. I alsosubtly adjusted the background color to a light grey. Celadon was originally used for the nav and footer, however I forfeited this color as it didnt mesh well with the rest of the site.

- **Typography**

For fonts I went for Oswald for headings and inter for other text. They both go well together and give a cool calm look. If there are any import issues fall backs have been added as sans-serif

- **Images**

For our images I aimed to implement similar contrast pictures to the website colors. This helped to blend well within the website.

[//]: <> (UX Wireframes)
- **Wireframes**
I made my wireframes using figma, this was then molded and made into my websites, original designs on these figma wireframes have been tweaked. Specifically the colors within the website was changed due to celadon not being very fitting within the webpage
